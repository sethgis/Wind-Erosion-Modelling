General Information
=====================
TrofMIS is a surveilance system that is based on monitoring the Tropical Montane Forest in the IGAD region. The Tropical montane monitoring is part
of the global goal in reducing carbon emission and consequently exponentially reducing climate change. 
The tropical forest monitoring is keen on applying the REDD+ monitoring guidelines outlined by UNCCD on tropical forest and carbon emission monitoring
to yield these products.

	- Forest cover status (tree cover density mask for a reference year 2015) maps
	- Forest cover change (annual change 2016-2020) maps
	- Forest canopy disturbance alert (using both optical and active sensors)
	- TrofMIS generation/derivation of RADAR Forest Cover Loss Alerts, Tree Cover Density, Forest Canopy Disturbance Monitoring products on selected tropical forests for REDD+ reporting once new data is availableTraining materials (user manual) on the developments of the data acquisition, analysis and generation of final products.
	
The goal is to anable the various key players in REDD+ reporting while account for the amount of carbon stock emmitted as well as retained.

Aknowledgement
--------------
Special appreciation to the `ICPAC <https://www.icpac.net/>`_ team for the great support in validation of the outputs as well as 
contribution to refine the methodologies. 
Appreciation to the countries patners who were part of the great work in providing feedback on the products generated.
The `JRC <https://www.icpac.net/>`_ team provided good reference in developing the forest products for visualisation as well as a 
base reference for more so forest monitoring alerts using Sentinel 2 sensors.
