Computing Climate Erosivity Factor (CE) -  Country Scale Product
*************************************************************************
To compute the climate erosivity factor at a country scale. Please follow the following steps 
to request the layer.


1.Request for a layer and region of interest
*************************************************************************
A country of interest as well as a factor of interest, is requested as shown below.
Once the user requests the layer, the map is visualised as is shown in the map view below.

2.Compare Climate Erosivity layer
*************************************************************************
Once a layer has been requested, a user can compare that requsted layer within the region of interest, with any other available 
wind erosion factors including:
   * Climate Erosivity of a different year
   * Erodible fraction factor of same of a different year
   * Soil Crust factor 
   * Vegetation Sensitivity layer
   * Surface Roughness layers as shown below.
