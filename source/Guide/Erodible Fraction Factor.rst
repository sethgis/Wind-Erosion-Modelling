***************************************************
Computing Erodible Fraction Factor (EF)
***************************************************
This is the ability of soil to resist wind erosion based on

soil (Fryrear et al., 1998) as expressed in equation below.

For users to compute the Erodible fraction, the uillustration below, clearly followed, will generate the desired output.
For the specific countries, a user should define the country of interest, as well as the product of interest.
