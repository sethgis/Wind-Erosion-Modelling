Computing Index of Land Susceptibility to Wind Erosion (ILSWE) 
*****************************************************************
Index of Land Susceptibility to Wind Erosion is the ultimate product, generated 
when wind factors are intergrated using a multiplication logic.
The output  maps out areas that are sensitive or susceptible to 
be affected by soil particle movement.

Computation and request of Wind Erosion Sensitivity is requested as shown below.
