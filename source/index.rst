The Regional Centre for Mapping of Resource for Development (RCMRD), under the Global Monitoring for Environment 
and Security & Africa (GMES & Africa) project, implemented Earth Observation based 
System for Land Susceptibility to Wind Erosion (LaSWE). 
The applicationâ€™s main aim was to use Earth Observation methods/algorithms and tools to generate geospatial 
data products for Wind Erosion Modelling. 

The overall LaSWE goal aligns with GMES & Africa thematic chapters identified and 
agreed on for the Action Plan, which includes:

* Long term Management of Natural Resources; 
* Water Resource Management; 
* Marine & Coastal Areas Management; 
* Food Security and Rural Development; 
* Climate Variability and Change; 
* Disaster Risk Reduction; 
* Health; 
* Conflict and Political Crisis, and 
* Infrastructure and Territorial Development.


Thus, LaSWE implementation ensures an evidenced based information, that will support the end users and stakeholders towards 
monitoring and assessing wind erosion impacts in the Eastern Africa Region, 
in order to achieve sustainable environemntal resource management and use.
