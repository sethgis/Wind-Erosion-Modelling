Frequently Asked Question (FAQ)
==========================================

LaSWE is a monitoring system that monitors the land susceptibility to wind erosion in the Eastern Africa Region.


TroFMIS is a surveilance system that monitors Tropical Montane Forest in the Eastern Africa region. 
Environmental monitoring and conservation is part
of the sustainable development goal towards achieving sustainable environmental usage. This is achieved through development of verifiable
methods of wind erosion modelling. 
Through development of verifiable methods for environmental monitoring, some sub products are generated for LaSWE, including: 

	* Climate Erosivity Factor (CE)
	* Fractional Vegetation Cover  (FVC)
	* Soil Roughness Factor (SR) 
	* Erodible Fraction Factor (EF)
 	* Soil Crust Factor (SC)

	
The products in LaSWE enables key stakeholders and end users in monitoring the continous 
land degration. The various users, will also be able to do periodical analysis on environmental change.

Authors
--------------
TroFMIS system was implemented by RCMRD under the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security & Africa(GMES & Africa)
project. A project co-funded by the African Union (AU) and the European Union (EU).


What is Wind Erosion
--------------------------
Wind Erosion is the systematic soil partcile movement by wind force.


How many factors did you consider during your modelling?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We considered five major factors, which was a revision from previously 11 factors used by other scholars.
The factors majorly are reduced to 5 factors of modelling.

Can someone include another modelling factor?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, based on the application, and accuracy, a sixth factor can be added. However, we encourage the use of only 5 factors as is 
in th eliteratures.
 
Does the factors change over the years?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, for some factors sucvh as climate erosivity, with dynamic datasets such as rainfall, it changes. This 
is inclusive of vegetation cover and land use land cover for soil roughness, which changes every two years.
  
Why did you use land cover in place or land roughness ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In places where there is lack of roughness data, Land use land cover are given C fator values, that
assigns weights for various land use land cover classes. Again, the roughness inedx did not have lots of studies carried out, thus
minimal referncing for its use and application. Challenge comes in, in handling the values generated from such products.
